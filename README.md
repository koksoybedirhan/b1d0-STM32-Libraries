Here is the some sensor libraries for STM32 processors.
You can directly copy and paste files and you can add your projects.
When you add files in the project, you have to paste .h files in Core->Inc file and you have to paste .c files in Core->Src file.
After that, you have to include .h files in Core->Src->main.c file.

That's all! You can start to work in project with including drivers.
