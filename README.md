# b1d0-STM-libs
Here is the some sensor libraries for STM32 processors written by b1d0.
You can directly copy and paste files and you can add your projects.
When you add files in the project, you can paste .h files in Core->Inc file and you can paste .c files in Core->Src file.
After that you have to include .h files in Core->Src->main.c file.

That's all! You can start to work in project with including drivers.
